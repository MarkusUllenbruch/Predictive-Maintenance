# Predictive-Maintenance using LSTM
## Predictive Maintenance of NASA Turbofan Dataset

### 0. Introduction
Predictive maintenance is from high importance, when it comes to security and cost issues and to perform efficient decisions in todays digitalization and industry 4.0.
It is seen as an Internet of Things (IoT) technology, because the concept is to make machines like turbofans of aircrafts intelligent. That means recording all the sensor signals available from the machine and input them into a Machine Learning/ Deep Learning algorithm to predict some factors that indicate in what lifetime stage the machine is at the moment and how long the machine can be driven safely from now on until the machine must be maintained or thrown away.
Outcomes to predict can be the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in days, weeks, months or cycles, which is a regression problem. It could also be categories of lifetime stages like green, yellow and red where green indicates, that the machine is very healthy and red means it can develop a damage in the next 20-days or cycles, for example- which would be a classification problem.
Time series data from machine sensors can be analyzed and trained with LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) Neural Network structures, that have kind of a memory function.
